Dash VTK
    VTK stands for Visualization Toolkit and is a popular library written in C++ which is also available in Python for doing data processing and visualization in the scientific and medical fields. Typically VTK is used to visualize 3D geometries from simulations or sensors such as LIDAR scanner. For the medical world, VTK is used to render 3D images (i.e. CT, MRI, ...) by doing volume rendering and/or slicing.
