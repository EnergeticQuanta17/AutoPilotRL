# PyQt5 GUI for Selecting RL Algorithms and Environments - Training

This project streamlines the selection of RL algorithms and environments with a PyQt5-based graphical user interface (GUI) that makes the process more accessible and user-friendly.

## Usage

### Run the RLAgent_GUI.py file

 - Choose the RL Algorithm to train the model on
 - Use the _Refresh_ option to load 10 random environments from all the list of available envriomnents in OpenAI Gym
 - Choose the Policy to be used to train the RL Agent
 - Click the submit button to launch the training of the Agent 
 - Once the training is complete, the Agent will be tested in the Environment to evaluate its performance.
